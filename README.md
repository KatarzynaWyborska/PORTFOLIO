## About me

My name is Katarzyna Wyborska. I am at the beginning of my journey to become Software Tester. in my portfolio, I would like to share with you my testing knowladge and show my technical skills, which I gained on course and through my selflearning. 
My goal is to develop as a Software Tester. I am now looking for a junior position in testing area.

My international experience equips me with valuable tools such as open mind and adaptability. I enjoy learning newthings and exploring new opportunites.
