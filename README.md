# PORTFOLIO

## About me

My name is Katarzyna Wyborska. I am at the beginning of my journey to become Software Tester.
In my portfolio, I would like to share my testing knowledge and show my technical skills, which I gained on course and through my self-learning. My goal is to develop as a Software Tester. I am now looking for a junior position in testing area. 

I believe that high quality is the bestselling point of services and products. Thanks to my diverse experience from previous workplaces, I have highly developed interpersonal skills and empathy which give me a wider perspective and better understanding of contexts. My international experience equips me with valuable tools such as open mind and adaptability. I enjoy learning new things and exploring new opportunities.

**My experience**

My previous experience varies from office assistance through customer service supporter to Label coordinator in medical company.  
I my career, I have two opportunities to test software as a user. In Arvato, I have tested ticketing system Rave 2.0 and in Coloplast - Labelling and Artwork Managing Software [Kallik](https://www.kallik.com/). In both cases I did not have any test cases or scenarios prepared, I have been following processes and using my experience. Bugs found by me was reported to person responsible for the testings via Excel file.
